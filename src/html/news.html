    <p>Today I have been setting up and configuring DKIM, SPF, and DMARC.<br>
      Self-hosting email is highly discouraged, but I really want to dig in deep into the requirements and keep up to date with how everything works.<br>
      Most organizations simply offload the heavy-lifting to Microsoft, Google, or even Yahoo.<br>
      This is recommended and completely fine.<br>
      However, there are some use cases (although rare) where running your own email server is required.</p>
